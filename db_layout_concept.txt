I have an issue here, one that I think is the reason most sites are the way
that they are. I need to have parent food items, and conversions.

For instance Onion > Yellow Onion > Chopped Yellow Onion
and I need to know that 1/2 of an average medium onion equal say 2 cups of
chopped yellow onion.

On top of that, I want to be able to convert to other substitues. So for
instance, 2 cups of chopped yellow onion could be substituted for 8Tbsp of
onion flakes or 4Tbsp of onion powder whatever the conversion matrix is there.

some processing is needed here to figure out conversions. If someone is entering a new
item, and they fill out the package details some of this should be possible determine.
Ideally some user somewhere or likely I will measure a volume to determine the g_per_ml ratio
which makes everything else possible

I think I can default items with an unknown ratio with a null conversion ratio
just allowing them not to be converted from volume to weight. But the packaging should still
set the
